    <p> When I first started fly fishing with my soon-to-be brother-in-law I would always ask "where are the good spots?" "let's go where we know the fish are going to be".
      I slowly but surely realized it was not about catching the fish. But more taking in the scenery of the mountains,
       being there in the moment and taking in the beauty. To me, fly fishing is exploring your surroundings, leaving your problems at home, and maybe catching a fish or two. 
       If there is thinking of potentially trying it out, I could not recommend it enough. Yes, it is an expensive sport but you can always find someone selling used items and be able to get started with all 
       your gear for under $300. Lastly, my biggest advice I can give is, research, research, and more research.
