    <h2><em>Tying your own flies</em></h2>
        <p>Personally, I have never learned to tie my own flies many people enjoy it and they might even say they like it more than fishing.
            It has to be a great feeling knowing that you spent your time and effort tying the fly and being able to get a fish to bite it. 
            Maybe one day I will be able to experience it.  but for now, i will stick to exploring our great state of Idaho and all it has to offer.</p>
